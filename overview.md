# WHAT IS VUE?

- Front-end, Javascript / Typescript framework
- used to create dynamic & data-driven websites (SPA's)
- Can also be used to create stand-alone widgets


  * Vue Websites
    - vue is used to create a whole website with multiple pages & components
    - these websites are normally called single page applications (SPA)
    - all routing is done in the browser & not on the server

  * Single Page Application (SPA)
    - only a single html page sent (initially) to the browser
    - vue intercepts subsequent requests and handles "page" changes in the browser by swapping what components are shown on the page
    - results in a much faster and smoother website experience
